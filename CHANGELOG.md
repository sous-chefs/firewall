## Unreleased

Standardise files with files in sous-chefs/repo-management

## 7.0.2 - *2025-09-04*

## 7.0.1 - *2025-01-30*

### Fixed

- `firewall_rule` doesn't default protocol to `tcp` when using `dest_port` property.

## 7.0.0 - *2025-01-03*

### Summary

Key changes in this release:

- **Rich Rules on firewalld**: The `firewall_rule` resource now creates [rich rules](https://firewalld.org/documentation/man-pages/firewalld.richlanguage.html) on firewalld platforms instead of using the deprecated `--direct` interface.
- **Flexible firewall selection**: The cookbook now uses the `default['firewall']['solution']` attribute to determine the firewall solution to use instead of a hardcoded assignment for each platform. It defaults to the platform's native firewall (same as previous hardcoded values).
- **Firewalld 2.0.0**: Platforms using firewalld 2.0.0 and later, such as RHEL 10 and Ubuntu 24.04, are now supported.

### Upgrade Instructions

This release introduces breaking changes. To upgrade to this release:

- Migrate usages of the `disabled` property on `firewall` resources to the `enabled` property instead.
- Migrate usages of `default['firewall']['firewalld']` attributes to `firewalld_zone` resources.
- Remove usages of the `:save` action from `firewall_rule` resources. Rules are now always saved permanently.
- Remove usages of the `permanent` property on `firewall_rule` resources. Rules are now always saved permanently.
- Remove usages of the `disabled_zone` and `enabled_zone` properties on `firewall` resources. Use the `firewalld_zone` resource to manage firewalld zone configuration.
- Replace usages of the `firewall::firewalld` recipe with `firewall::default`.
- Migrate usages of attributes `default['firewall']['ubuntu_iptables']` and `default['firewall']['redhat7_iptables']` with `default['firewall']['solution']`.

### Added

- Support for firewalld 2.0.0 and the platforms that use it; RHEL 10 and Ubuntu 24.04.
  - `priority`, `ingress_priority`, `egress_priority` properties added to `firewalld_zone`.
- Added `firewalld_rich_rule` resource for adding/removing [rich rules](https://firewalld.org/documentation/man-pages/firewalld.richlanguage.html) to/from firewalld zones.
- Support for IPv6 rules on firewalld platforms.
- Support for using any compatible firewall solution on any platform. Defaults to the operating system's default firewall solution.

### Changed

- Ensure `firewalld` service remains enabled and started when installed.
- `firewall_rule` resource now creates rich rules on firewalld platforms, instead of the using the deprecated `--direct` firewalld interface.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `firewall_rule` resource fails with a `--zone is an invalid option with --direct` error on firewalld.
- Fixed: New zones created by `firewalld_zone` unexpectedly have forwarding enabled by default.
- Fixed: `firewalld_*` resources ignore properties whose value is `false`.
- Fixed: `firewalld_*` resources were not idempotent when using `ports`, `source_ports`, and `rich_rules` properties.
- Fixed: `ufw` provider doesn't ensure `ufw` service is enabled.

### Removed

- Removed deprecated `disabled` property from `firewall` resource.
- Removed all `default['firewall']['firewalld']` attributes. Use the `firewalld_zone` resource to manage firewalld zone configuration.
- Removed firewalld action `:save` from `firewall` resource. Firewalld rules are now always added permanently.
- Removed firewalld property `permanent` from `firewall_rule` resource. Firewalld rules are now always added permanently.
- Removed properties `disabled_zone` and `enabled_zone` from `firewall` resource. Use the `firewalld_zone` resource to manage firewalld zone configuration.
- Removed recipe `firewall::firewalld`. Its functionality has been merged into the `firewall::default` recipe.
- Removed attributes `default['firewall']['ubuntu_iptables']` and `default['firewall']['redhat7_iptables']`. Use the new `default['firewall']['solution']` attribute to set the desired firewall solution to use.
